# Repository Migration Notice

⚠️ **Important**: Due to unresolved Git issues, I've decided to switch to a new repository structure.  

### Why?
- As a beginner, I encountered problems with nested Git repositories and incomplete file tracking.
- Despite attempts to fix it (merging, rebasing, force pushes), the issues persisted.
- The AI assistance I used couldn't resolve the problem due to my limited Git knowledge.

### What's Next?
- This new repo will now track **all files** from `H:\VSCODE` correctly.
- My 1st projects (like `1-Calculator.py`, `2-Coder.py`, `3-KBC.py`) are preserved in the `1 jun 2025/Learning-Phase/python/` folder in this repo.

### Learn More
For more details on this repo, read another README.md present in `1 jun 2025` Folder, Make sure to read it out!

> **Note**: This is a fresh start—no more nested `.git` headaches!
